This is a rust version of [AgentSmith](https://github.com/mattyleecifer/AgentSmithU), a tool for making AI agents as well as a chatbot.

I started this project to learn rust with something I'm already familiar with.

This has basic chat functionalities working as well as command-line flags and it can probably make Agents as well (but untested). There is no web GUI - I'm not sure I will implement one.

It's possible that this works with the Python module, but again, untested. I may make it a real proper Python module at one point.
